1
00:00:11,73 --> 00:00:15,77
Video bridges the gap between survivors and audiences

2
00:00:15,77 --> 00:00:18,98
between seeing and changing.

3
00:00:18,98 --> 00:00:22,77
At WITNESS the purpose of video is to get the story told

4
00:00:22,77 --> 00:00:26,04
the right people to see it and action taken.

5
00:00:26,73 --> 00:00:31,48
WITNESS has been empowering women around the world for 17 years

6
00:00:31,48 --> 00:00:37,54
partnering with organizations and working on issues impacting women and girls.

7
00:00:39,18 --> 00:00:42,34
From exposing the trafficking of women in eastern Europe

8
00:00:42,34 --> 00:00:45,95
to advocating for women landmine victims in Senegal

9
00:00:45,95 --> 00:00:50,28
to protecting our elderly from abuse, right here in the United States...

10
00:00:50,28 --> 00:00:52,62
WITNESS changes lives.

11
00:00:53,66 --> 00:00:57,34
Women who have survived human rights abuses are speaking up

12
00:00:57,34 --> 00:01:00,63
so that others won't experience the same injustices.

13
00:01:18,78 --> 00:01:21,58
Violence against women in Zimbabwe is because

14
00:01:21,58 --> 00:01:25,45
women are becoming more and more involved in politics.

15
00:01:25,45 --> 00:01:29,48
To try and to stop these women from involvement in politics

16
00:01:29,48 --> 00:01:32,17
they are beaten, they are sexually assaulted.

17
00:01:32,17 --> 00:01:35,57
RAU decided to work with WITNESS

18
00:01:35,57 --> 00:01:38,95
because it will give people a chance to watch the film

19
00:01:38,95 --> 00:01:41,77
and then to see what is going on in Zimbabwe.

20
00:01:43,56 --> 00:01:47,02
In Yemen, witnesses working with the Sisters Arab Forum

21
00:01:47,02 --> 00:01:50,20
to advocate for the rights of minority "Akhdam" women

22
00:01:59,85 --> 00:02:01,94
The video was screened in Yemen to members

23
00:02:01,94 --> 00:02:05,01
of Parliament, journalists and civil society

24
00:02:05,01 --> 00:02:08,34
and has unfortunately since been banned.

25
00:02:08,58 --> 00:02:11,04
WITNESS is working to have the ban lifted.

26
00:02:12,21 --> 00:02:17,66
In Mexico, DUAL INJUSTICE tells the story of 19-year old Neyra

27
00:02:17,66 --> 00:02:21,70
who disappeared on her way home from school in 2003.

28
00:02:27,58 --> 00:02:32,23
WITNESS recently met the mexican president and select government officials.

29
00:02:32,83 --> 00:02:34,94
They have since created a working group

30
00:02:34,94 --> 00:02:37,04
to end the disappearances and murders that have

31
00:02:37,04 --> 00:02:41,71
claimed the lives of over 450 girls and young women.

32
00:02:43,10 --> 00:02:45,90
In Macedonia, our WITNESS partner advocates

33
00:02:45,90 --> 00:02:48,64
to end violence and discrimination against women

34
00:02:48,64 --> 00:02:50,65
including sex workers.

35
00:03:05,71 --> 00:03:08,90
Violence and discrimination against women and girls

36
00:03:08,90 --> 00:03:13,15
is one of today's most pervasive human rights violations.

37
00:03:13,15 --> 00:03:16,52
WITNESS empowers those standing up for the rights of women

38
00:03:16,52 --> 00:03:20,32
to expose injustices, tell their stories

39
00:03:20,32 --> 00:03:22,89
and create lasting change.
