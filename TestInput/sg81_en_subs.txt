Video bridges the gap between survivors and audiences
between seeing and changing.
At WITNESS the purpose of video is to get the story told
the right people to see it and action taken.
WITNESS has been empowering women around the world for 17 years
partnering with organizations and working on issues impacting women and girls.
From exposing the trafficking of women in eastern Europe
to advocating for women landmine victims in Senegal
to protecting our elderly from abuse, right here in the United States
WITNESS changes lives.
Women who have survived human rights abuses are speaking up
so that others won't experience the same injustices.
Violence against women in Zimbabwe is because
women are becoming more and more involved in politics.
To try and to stop these women from involvement in politics

RAU decided to work with WITNESS
because it will give people a chance to watch the film
and then to see what is going on in Zimbabwe.
