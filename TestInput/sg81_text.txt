WHAT DO YOU DO?
Je travaille en informatique et je travaille avec Open Office et GIMP (I work in IT and I work with Open Office and GIMP)
I'm involved in a Women's Group named Académie (...?) which is a group for women in free software in Brussels. We meet more or less every 2 months, and the project is to learn together how to run a server, a women's server for all women's projects.
I'm an (...?) for an environmental NGO in Amsterdam, Linux of course (Debian and Ubuntu). I've work with (...) servers for the past 10 years.
So what I'm basically doing is some advocacy and ???. I'm looking to get a bit more involved. - What do you want to get involved in? - Mainly in the ?? 3 Conference, that's the thing I'd like to begin with most probably
Lot's of different little things in Wikimedia. I write little scripts, I used to write ??
Currently I'm voluntaring at FOSDEM helping out. In general I'm a teacher in Maths and Computer Science in High School. I'm hoping to get my students in the future more involved with Open Source
I'm using Drupal to create an online project management system. I want to build a simpler one for students to use because we have a lot of student group projects - but the students are disorganized. I want it to be more light-weight and to have a lot of functionalities that students understand, and not stuff that they aren't going to use.
I work as a software tester during my day job, and in the open communities I try to help women to get involved. I also work on an NGO project which is trying to showcase a non-profit use of open source and how we can actually better help them.
I'm localizing Camino and Mozilla products in French
Soy vize-presidenta de una organisacion de software libre. Nos dedicamos a promover el software libre y el conocimiento libre.
Right now, I'm programmer for the Wikimedia Foundation. Before that I was a Free Software Foundation ?? so I have a lot of involvement in Open Source projects
WHY?
Parce que je suis pour le free software ! (laughs)(Because I am for Free Software! (laughs))
At the beginning I got into computers for political reasons and also because I needed to publish, I wanted to do newspapers and I got into Linux and whatever... everything for political reasons
Free Software is the best!
[laughs]
I started talking to somebody! I'm still very upset with this guy because I wanted to work on ...(I can't catch what she's saying here :) )and he sort of tricked me into doing articles and then I ended up doing some of the technical stuff in Wikimedia, sometimes
In schools in the Netherlands most of what's used is proprietary software - mostly windows-based
and I'm hoping to at least make students more aware of alternatives. So that at least they know that they have the choice and hoping to continue that when I graduate!
I do it because I actually enjoy working on Open Source and I find it's very interesting to see that communities can use Open Source and still be productive and make profit and continue (???)
First I started to use Mozilla back in 2001 and my boyfriend helped me to contribute. He wanted to contribute and I helped him too. And so now we still contribute as much as we can.
No sé. Recientement cai en el software libre, creo que es une filosofia muy bonita que "el compatir es vivir" y pienso que todos deberiamos participar en proyectos de software libre... de alguna manera.
(translation = I don't know. I fell inside free software not that long ago, I find its philosophy of "sharing is living" beautiful and I think that we should all participate in free software projects... one way or another.)
Why I do it? Well A: I love programming. I love programming for places where it's making (?) things more accesible, where it makes a difference, where it's not some corporation that, you know, makes money... I mean, I fell inlove with software combined with getting things *to* people
